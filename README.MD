# IDEA EDU Course ...

Implemented in the Java Backend Developer Track of hyperskill.org' JetBrain Academy.

Main purpose of doing this project, is to complete the Java Backend Developer track, which now is at 93% applied core topics 
and 98% learned topics overall.

But above all, the project sounds fun and challenging from comments. It is in an early beta version, has few completions,
so it seems like a challenge and opportunity to deepen the Spring boot experiences - though I am working with Spring boot
professionally every day now.

## Technology / External Libraries

- Spring Boot 2.7.1,
- Spring Web MVC - with Tomcat
- H2 Database 2.1.214 or later 
- Spring Data JPA / Hibernate
- Lombok' annotation processors,
- Apache Log4j SLF4J API binding to Log4j 2 logging and
- Junit 5 with
- Mockito (mockito-inline) testing.

## Repository Contents

The sources of main project tasks (6 stages) and the unit, mockito, spring testing.

## Program description

Coming up soon...

Have fun!
